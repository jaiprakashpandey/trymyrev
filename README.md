Nuthing fancy, Just tried to add my own custom utility program to reverse String, can be useful as an utility for future program 
and kind of self propriatory rather dependent on other third party libraries which comes with other unnecessary loaded code which we dont need in relaity!

There are 7 test cases added to test blank, null and small & longt strings with special characters as well- found to be running fine without any issue as of now.

WIll contribute more in coming future for single operation utility as world is moving towards independednt single operation approach rather dependent on other libraries.


Steps to use:

 There is already artefacts built , add that light weight jar to your classpath , and create object of MainCliet by passing the String in question
 or invoke the executable jar via commandline externally by passing th eprogram parameter as first argument - good to be integrated this light weight library with external systems(ETL, QUARTZ, other interfaces or satellite system within an organization).
